A simple GUI for carrying out pre-activity checks.
Checks are read from a simple text file called checklist.txt, one item to a line.
C style single line comments are supported.  
The !Launch program directive will display a button to launch program.
The return key will advance to the next item. Any other key will focus the notes field.
